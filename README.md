CoverageVis
===========
CoverageVis can visualize code coverage for Java programs.


Data mappings:
size of package(lines of code)                  --> size of circle
line/branch coverage(ranges from [0.0 - 1.0])   --> color of circle(red to green)
dependencies between packages                   --> links connectint circles
times of dependencies                           --> width of links



Requirements:


How to run:
1, Use Cobertura to generate code coverage for your Java project. It should
generate a XML file called coverage.xml under your project directory.

2, Run a static analysis script on your project. It will collect some important
information about your project, like size of packages and dependencies between
packages. After this, it will generate a json file called data.json.

3, CoverageVis will visualize the data.json file generated by last step.
